# ScoreFlow 
### Score Tracker App

ScoreFlow is a Progressive Web App built with React, JavaScript, and plain CSS. It allows users to track scores for various competitive games such as badminton and basketball. The app has a friendly and intuitive UI/UX.

## Games
###  Currently availiable games: 

 - Badminton
 - Basketball

### Badminton

The Badminton portion of the app lets you choose the winning score from 11 to 21. The winning team should be at least 2 points ahead to win a round.

### Basketball

The Basketball portion of the app consists of four sets for 5 minutes each, with the ability to pause the game. You can increment the score by 1 point for free throws, 2 points for field goals, and 3 points for shots beyond the 3-point line.

## Rules

### Badminton

Badminton is a racket sport that is played between two or four players. The goal is to hit a shuttlecock over a net and onto the opponent's side of the court, with the aim of making it impossible for the opponent to return the shuttlecock. The game is won by the first player or team to reach a predetermined number of points.

### Basketball

Basketball is a team sport that is played with two teams of five players each. The goal is to shoot a ball through a hoop that is mounted on a backboard on the opponent's side of the court. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are scored by shooting the ball through the hoop or by free throws.
